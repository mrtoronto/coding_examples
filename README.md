# web_scraper_examples

## Overview

A few friends have asked for help with coding and I've struggled to provide the same resources consistently. Below I'll collect all the information I can.

I'll add courses I've taken or heard good things about. I'll also post notebooks in this repo with walkthroughs of simple coding applications. 

I plan to start with web scraping as it is one of the best mixes of simple code and useful output that I can think of.

## External Resources

I'd highly recommend starting with a Coursera course. While I'm only recommending coding to you if I think you can handle it, I don't think self-guided learning is a very efficient way to begin coding. You have no idea what you don't know, yet. That being said, feel free to poke around different resources before starting a course but just don't get discouraged if it feels difficult.

### Beginning Resources

- [Python 4 Everyone (Course)](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python) is a great course to start with. They'll expose you to a few different coding applications and it'll give you a solid foundation to either pick your next course or pick another topic to run with.

- [Python 4 Everyone (Website)](https://www.py4e.com/lessons) is the website version of the above Coursera course. Like I previously mentioned, firmer guidance in the form of a course is probably going to be beneficial but this would be the next best thing.

After this first course, I'd think about what you learned and what you want to do. Eventually programming will feel similar to speaking so if you don't feel "fluent" yet, another course on general Python isn't out of the question. 

That being said, you can take your "conversational" Python skills pretty far without becoming "fluent". 

### Advanced Courses

These are courses I've taken or that I think look interesting to give you an idea where you can go once you've gotten started. I'll be sure to add to this list if I get good reviews from anyone or take more courses myself. 

#### Statistics

- [Statistics with R](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/statistics) - If you're planning to go into Data Science, this is a useful course to take. The focus is not on coding but you will be working in R so its a good opportunity to try out a new language in a low pressure environment. Topics covered include statistical inference, regression and a bit of bayesian statistics. 

#### Web Design

- [Web Design for Everybody: Basics of Web Development & Coding Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/web-design?) - This course goes over building websites and what is needed to make a responsive, useful website. Web design seems scary because it involves a lot of new acronyms and languages but once you can get past the exterior, the core of web design revolves around design, not complex coding problems. 

#### Data Science

- [Applied Data Science with Python Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python) - This course goes over a few topics within Applied Data Science. This starts with plotting, goes into ML, text mining and then eventually network analysis. This course is not meant to learn python in so make sure your python skills are sharp before jumping in.

- [Advanced Data Science with IBM](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/advanced-data-science-ibm) - This is not a course for the python newbie. You'll be working with Spark through Python to run parallel operations on large datasets. The topics covered include signal processing and AI. If your goal is to learn Spark, I would recommend a different course as this course essentially just "uses" Spark instead of teaching it. 

#### Machine Learning / Deep Learning

- [Machine Learning by Stanford University](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome) - While slightly outdated in spots, this course will give you a fantastic overview of the fundamentals of machine learning. Many of these topics aren't just specific to ML and will come up in the area of data science. 

- [Deep Learning by deeplearning.ai](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) - This course has a great walkthrough of Deep Learning starting with basic feed-forward neural networks then goes into hyperparameter tuning, and regularization. After building up the foundation using basic Neural Nets, the course expands to include convolutional and recurrent neural networks. 

 - [Machine Learning with TensorFlow on Google Cloud Platform]() - This course was a good exposure to the Google Cloud Platform. Knowing how to use cloud hosting services like GCP and AWS is very important in tech today. This course was entirely done with the GCP and that never felt like a burden which is impressive. The content of the course was heavily focused on Tensorflow, specifcally building and tuning models in Tensorflow.
